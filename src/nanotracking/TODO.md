- Finish refresh functionality
- Move enable/disable_peak_detection, enable/disable_cumulative, and enable/disable_difference into new `nanotracking.analysis`
  - Make these user-defined, too?
- Instead of (or in addition to) Calculation name, show format name in CSV files
- Make all info.md settings user-defined, such that the user chooses the settings' names, how many there are, how they will be displayed, etc.
- Add a simple ViewSizer 3000 settings object that maps setting names and values from .xml to Setting objects
- Housekeeping
  - Rename "sizes" to "counts" and possibly "bins" to "sizes"
  - Rename kernel_size and its relatives to something like kernel_span to avoid confusion with particle sizes
  - Condense attribute initialization (self.x = x for some attribute x) into one line in Setting.__init__() and other places
  - Make diagram(s) of the codebase, laying out how data structures are handled, operated on, etc.
  - Rename format_callback to format_function? May be more accurate
  - Add assertion that each column_number corresponds to exactly one Setting object (which may have subsettings to include multiple rows of information)
  - Add assertion that Setting tag has no spaces in Setting.__init__()
  - Fix parity of Setting.add_subsetting() arguments relative to those of Settings.add_setting()
- Add a Plot class to more easily distinguish between plotting functionality and other features. Currently too many plot-related methods in NTA class; easy to get lost
- Validate concentration values displayed on the table. Are we using the correct volume in the calculation?
- Fix broken find_truncation_index; plot currently shows just 1 bar, under 16 nm.
- Rename Calculation to Column
  - Use it for both calculations and groups of Setting objects
- Replace code specific to format strings with a simple "format callback maker," e.g. `format_callback = lambda *args: format_string.format(…………)`
- Save Calculation values in .npy files
- Test format strings to make sure they work, or remove them
- In test_Table, fix missing results in CSV
- Revisit the `particles` and `videos` attributes of Sample
- Fix bug: time since above isn't blank for the first row
**- Transfer Colab demo into a Runme file to track in git**
- Add ability to save user-specified calculations to NumPy files
- Add auto-refresh option
- Add file name templates to demo
- For clarity about the chronology of the experiment, replace treatment & wait columns with a single column with entries in this format:
  > Treatment 1 +
  > Wait 1 +
  > Treatment 2 +
  > Wait 2
  > etc.
- Clearly indicate that plots correspond to their adjacent rows in the table
- Detect "DATA_" prefix on folder and correct folder structure
- Move all user input and error-checking into setup, letting computation loops run efficiently
- Testing branch
  - Set up CircleCI
  - Add `nox` to automate `unittest` (or `pytest`) tests (and documentation generation, e.g. by `sphinx`) for different versions of Python, etc.
    - See Chris Wilcox presentation at PyCon 2019 on YouTube
  - Test all permutations of table commands in test_Table.py
  - Add test to ensure correct formatted text is put in the table
- Switch from `setuptools` to `meson`
- Set up benchmarking, e.g. Airspeed Velocity
- Use more efficient debugging, e.g. `pdb`
  - Learn concepts and practices of proper debugging
- Make a template JSON file, info.json, containing all possible options the user can specify for a "sample"/"measurement." Keep this in src folder for easy reference, and programmatically copy it to describe each case.
  - If info.md is kept, fix bug: breaks when info.md has spaces around equal signs
- Add experimental unit in test_Table.py
- Add default/template format/value callbacks, e.g. for time (nta.table_add_time)
- Add Setting objects as attributes (setattr) of Settings object
- Add option to plot .dat files other than those whose names start with "ConstantBinsTable_"
- When animating particle trajectories, plot ViewSizer's trajectories all in one color, but have the shading darken when paths for each particle cross. Then in another color, add trajectories calculated by TrackPy for validation
- Add docstrings
- Add properties/functions to NTA class:
  - Functions/properties that access associated data from files, for example:
    - Bins
    - Averages & standard deviations; think about the scaling required for proper plotting and determine whether this has a physical interpretation
  - Function to add a custom sample property
  - Helper functions that automatically perform pandas.read_csv on associated CSV files generated by NTA.compare()
  - Helper functions that add blank info.md files or modify existing ones to match keyword arguments
    - Replace info.md with JSON files; eliminate slow parsing in Python
  - Figure and Axes objects; user should be able to customize the plot
- Add analysis tools under nanotracking.analysis
- Make plots non-overlapping when showing black points & lines on top
  - Or better: invert colors when overlapping, and replace black bars with a secondary color that goes with the underlying plot
- Random walk simulation & visualization for validating tracking & analysis
  - Include TrackPy
- Add assessments of error, noise, etc. based on videos
- Rewrite most of the package in C for speed
  - When possible, split aspects of the package (e.g. graphics) into separate .h files to make them potentially useful for other projects
- Add an option to replace Matplotlib with OpenGL/WebGL
- Add NanoSight support
- Long-term (and possibly infeasible) ideas:
  - Add molecular dynamics simulations with templates for common nanoparticles (e.g. liposomes) and estimate the simulation parameters using NTA data
  - Add classical simulations of lipid membrane physics and estimate the simulation parameters using NTA data
    - May be helpful for studying fusogens (which would affect liposome sizes measured in NTA), etc.
  - Add a feature to automatically control keyboard and mouse to optimize ViewSizer settings based on the sample being measured
    - Probably bad idea
