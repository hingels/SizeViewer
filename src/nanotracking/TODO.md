- Add option to plot .dat files other than those whose names start with "ConstantBinsTable_"
- When animating particle trajectories, plot ViewSizer's trajectories all in one color, but have the shading darken when paths for each particle cross. Then in another color, add trajectories calculated by TrackPy for validation
- Add docstrings
- Add properties/functions to NTA class:
  - Functions/properties that access associated data from files, for example:
    - Bins
    - Averages & standard deviations; think about the scaling required for proper plotting and determine whether this has a physical interpretation
  - Function to add a custom sample property
  - Helper functions that automatically perform pandas.read_csv on associated CSV files generated by NTA.compare()
  - Helper functions that add blank info.md files or modify existing ones to match keyword arguments
    - Replace info.md with JSON files; eliminate slow parsing in Python
  - Figure and Axes objects; user should be able to customize the plot
- Add more efficient debugging/testing
- Add analysis tools under nanotracking.analysis
- Make plots non-overlapping when showing black points & lines on top
  - Or better: invert colors when overlapping, and replace black bars with a secondary color that goes with the underlying plot
- Random walk simulation & visualization for validating tracking & analysis
  - Include TrackPy
- Rewrite most of the package in C for speed
  - When possible, split aspects of the package (e.g. graphics) into separate .h files to make them potentially useful for other projects
- Add an option to replace Matplotlib with OpenGL/WebGL
- Add NanoSight support
- Long-term (and possibly infeasible) ideas:
  - Add molecular dynamics simulations with templates for common nanoparticles (e.g. liposomes) and estimate the simulation parameters using NTA data
  - Add classical simulations of lipid membrane physics and estimate the simulation parameters using NTA data
    - May be helpful for studying fusogens (which would affect liposome sizes measured in NTA), etc.
  - Add a feature to automatically control keyboard and mouse to optimize ViewSizer settings based on the sample being measured
    - Probably bad idea
